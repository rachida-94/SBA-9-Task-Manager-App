I built this Task Manager Dashboard by expanding on a previous lab project that featured simple task manager cards. Initially, I struggled to connect that setup with the new dashboard layout especially when trying to combine components like filters, search, and the task form all in one place without repeating code. To solve this, I redesigned the structure using reusable React components and introduced a central Dashboard that ties everything together. Within it, I linked the Sidebar for status and priority filters, the Search bar for quick task lookup, and the TaskList, which renders tasks using individual TaskItem components.
Each task supports editing and deletion, handled through shared functions like handleEditTask, handleDeleteTask, and handleStatusChange. When a task is edited, the EditTaskForm appears conditionally and reuses the same logic as task creation. I refactored the form to use a single state object (newTask), which made both creation and editing much cleaner and easier to manage.
Filtering updates in real time via handleFilterChange, and the search input connects to handleSearchChangeâ€”both functions are centrally managed in the Dashboard and passed down as props. I used Tailwind CSS throughout the app for clean, responsive styling, and implemented localStorage to persist tasks even after page reloads.
